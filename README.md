# Beginner Neovim Config

Learning configurations.

## TODO:

Learn vim motions.

### Add these

**General**

- **Auto imports** - Auto add imports if I type a function name.
- **Git pull** - Auto pull on start (if no conflicts).
- **Show vim modes more clearly** I only show at bottom but perhaps on top too and maybe somewhere else?
- **List all projects** that have a .git folder? So I can pick what to work on today.
- **Easy Git** I do git push/pull daily. Hopefully somewhere where the commands is saved if I have to do stuff I dont do reguarly.

**Python**

- **.venv at start** I want my virtual enviroment to just work on start.

**Start**
Choose project, open projects with everything open.

**While**
Auto prettify, lint, save.

**End**
Write to file, format/lint, push to git.

### Fixes

- Telescope

1. Remove .git (and all .gitignore) from search.
